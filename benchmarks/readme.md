Benchmarks
-----------

Whenever possible, we benchmark our model implementation against results reported in the scientific literature.
This folder contains the figures generated from these comparisons, along with the Jupyter notebooks used to produce the plots.

If youâ€™re interested in reproducing or accessing the results, you can find the results files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tryFiXLySYgV7ivU5Uf8QOtaPm3GvatA?usp=sharing).
